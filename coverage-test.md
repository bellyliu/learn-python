# Python 2.7 Test Coverage with `coverage.py`

This guide provides an introduction to test coverage in Python 2.7 using the `coverage.py` library. It explains what test coverage is, why it's important, and how to generate and interpret coverage reports.

## What is Test Coverage?

Test coverage is a metric that reveals which lines of your code are executed by your tests. In Python 2.7, the `coverage.py` library is the standard tool for this purpose. It helps you identify parts of your application that are not being tested, which is crucial for improving software quality and reducing the likelihood of bugs.

## Why You Need Test Coverage

Think of it as a map of your code that's colored in every time a test runs through a specific path. Untested areas remain blank. This is important for several reasons:

* **Reveals Untested Code**: It pinpoints functions, branches, and statements that your tests don't exercise.
* **Improves Test Quality**: It encourages the creation of more thorough tests that cover edge cases and different execution paths.
* **Aids Refactoring**: When you refactor or change code, you can be more confident if you know the surrounding logic is well-tested.
* **Maintains Code Health**: Over time, it helps prevent "code rot" where parts of the codebase become untested and therefore untrustworthy.

## Key Components of Coverage

When you run `coverage.py`, it works in two main phases:

1.  **Execution**: You run your test suite using `coverage run`. As your tests execute, `coverage.py` monitors which lines of your application code are run. This information is stored in a data file, typically named `.coverage`.
2.  **Reporting**: After the tests complete, you use commands like `coverage report` or `coverage html` to analyze the collected data and generate a report.

## Reading the Coverage Report

The coverage report is your main tool for understanding how well your tests cover your code. You can generate a simple text-based report directly in your terminal or a more detailed HTML report.

To see the report in your terminal, run:

```bash
coverage report -m
